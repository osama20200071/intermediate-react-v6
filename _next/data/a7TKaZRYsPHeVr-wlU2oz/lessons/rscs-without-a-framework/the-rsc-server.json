Let's write a quick Fastify server to do this. I just chose Fastify because I like it; there's no reason you couldn't do Express, Restify, or any other API framework for Node.js.\n\nLet's create a `server` directory in the root directory of our project. Put in there a main.js file and put in there\n\n```javascript\nconst reactServerregister = require(\"react-server-dom-webpack/node-register\");\nreactServerregister();\n\nconst babelRegister = require(\"@babel/register\");\nbabelRegister({\n  ignore: [/[\\\\\\/](dist|server|node_modules)[\\\\\\/]/],\n  plugins: [\"@babel/transform-modules-commonjs\"],\n});\n\nrequire(\"./server\")();\n```\n\n- We're doing CommonJS for our server portion. I had it working with ES modules but it took so much extra code that this was simpler to teach you. Feel free to convert it later yourself. Everything else in this course will be ES modules.\n- This file does three things: it makes our Node.js server able to read React/JSX files, it makes it able to ES modules in our client code, and it makes it able to do RSCs via the webpack bundler by hooking into the module systems to render some portions and not others. Remember the `--conditions react-server` that we have in our CLI command? This is what that is for.\n- Why is this in a separate file? It's so all subsequent `require`/`import` calls can be run through Babel and the react-server-dom-webpack modules.\n\nOkay, let's start crafting our server.js file in the same directory. Let's just start with the basic machinery.\n\n```javascript\nconst path = require(\"node:path\");\nconst { readFileSync } = require(\"node:fs\");\nconst Fastify = require(\"fastify\");\nconst fastifyStaticPlugin = require(\"@fastify/static\");\nconst React = require(\"react\");\nconst { renderToPipeableStream } = require(\"react-server-dom-webpack/server\");\nconst AppImport = require(\"../src/App.jsx\");\n\nconst App = AppImport.default;\n\nconst MANIFEST = readFileSync(\n  path.resolve(__dirname, \"../dist/react-client-manifest.json\"),\n  \"utf8\"\n);\nconst MODULE_MAP = JSON.parse(MANIFEST);\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT ? process.env.PORT : 3000;\n\nconst fastify = Fastify({\n  logger: {\n    transport: {\n      target: \"pino-pretty\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nfastify.register(fastifyStaticPlugin, {\n  root: path.join(__dirname, \"../dist\"),\n  prefix: \"/assets/\",\n});\n\nfastify.register(fastifyStaticPlugin, {\n  root: path.join(__dirname, \"../public\"),\n  decorateReply: false,\n});\n\nfastify.get(\"/\", async function rootHandler(request, reply) {\n  return reply.sendFile(\"index.html\");\n});\n\nfastify.get(\"/react-flight\", function reactFlightHandler(request, reply) {\n  // we'll do this code in a sec\n});\n\nmodule.exports = async function start() {\n  try {\n    await fastify.listen({ port: PORT });\n  } catch (err) {\n    fastify.log.error(err);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n- Pretty standard Fastify app. We're serving two static folders, `public` which is our CSS but also could be images and some other stuff.
